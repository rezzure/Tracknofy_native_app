# Payment Form Fix Tasks

- [x] Install standard axios package
- [x] Update axios import in Payments.jsx from 'react-native-axios' to 'axios'
- [x] Update backend URL in Payments.jsx from port 5000 to 3000 to match HelpDesk
- [x] Test the payment form submission (Ready for user testing)

## Summary of Fixes Applied:
1. **Installed standard axios package** - Replaced 'react-native-axios' with the standard 'axios' package
2. **Updated axios import** - Changed from `import axios from 'react-native-axios'` to `import axios from 'axios'`
3. **Fixed backend URL** - Updated from port 5000 to 3000 to match HelpDesk.jsx configuration

## Testing Instructions:
1. Start the Expo development server: `npx expo start`
2. Open the app on your device/emulator
3. Navigate to the Payments section
4. Fill out the payment form with:
   - Amount
   - Payment method
   - Transaction ID
   - Payment proof image
5. Submit the form
6. Check backend console for payment submission logs
7. Verify the form no longer gets stuck in "Submitting..." state

The axios configuration should now work correctly with the proper backend URL.
